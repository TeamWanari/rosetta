# rosetta

[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/rosetta.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/rosetta)

This is a localization library to simplify Flutter localization with the help of code generation. It contains annotations to configure the `rosetta_generator`, which produces Helper classes for localization files, which can be used with `flutter_localizations` library.

## Configuration

1. Add `rosetta` to `pubspec.yaml` under the `dependencies:` section.
The latest version is [![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/rosetta.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/rosetta)

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter
  rosetta: ^latest_version
```

2. Add [build_runner](https://github.com/dart-lang/build/tree/master/build_runner) and `rosetta_generator` under the `dev_dependencies:` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file.
The latest version is [![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/rosetta_generator.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/rosetta_generator)

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.1.0
  rosetta_generator: ^latest_version
```

3. Add (or modify) the `build.yaml` file in the same folder as the `pubspec.yaml` and include the `rosetta` builder. Also if you placed your translation files outside the `lib` folder, you need to declare the path to be included in the generator build step.

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    sources:        // These lines with comments show how to declare the additional folders
      include:      // which contain the translations. In our case the i18n folder. Sadly
        - i18n/**   // if declare the include block we need to specify all our source folders
        - lib/**    // also.
    builders:
      rosetta:
```

## Usage

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:rosetta/rosetta.dart';
```

Create a class containing two static members which will be used later for localization:

```dart
class Translation {
  static LocalizationsDelegate<Translation> delegate;

  static Translation of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of(context, Translation);
  }
}
```

Annotate the class with the **rosetta** `Stone` annotation. The **path** parameter should point to a directory containing the [languageCode].json localization files.

```dart
@Stone(path: 'i18n')
class Translation {
  static LocalizationsDelegate<Translation> delegate;

  static Translation of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of(context, Translation);
  }
}
```

Include the part directive indicating the file that will be generated (typically the same file with a `.g` extension before `.dart`):

```dart
part 'rosetta_generator_example.g.dart';
```

Run build_runner:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

**Note:** On first attempt to run this command you might encounter a conflict error. If so, please add the --delete-conflicting-outputs argument to your command:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
(This additional argument allows the command to overwrite the `.g.dart` file if necessary.)

You can also use the `watch` command instead of `build`. This will generate your file when it's saved.

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

This process will generate 3 classes (let's assume that the annotated class was called `Translation` as in the example above):
* **`TranslationKeys`**: Contains all your keys as static fields, this is currently for internal use.
* **`_$TranslationDelegate`**: This is an implementation of `LocalizationsDelegate<Translation>`, this should be passed to `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp` as a localization delegate. Also should be passed to the static `delegate` attribute of your original class.
* **`_$TranslationHelper`**: An abstract class, which is meant to be used as an abstract base or mixed in to your annotated class. Contains functions to access the localized strings for each key (ex.: `String get emptyList => this.resolve(TranslationKeys.emptyList);`).

If you apply the generated classes you will end up something like this:

```dart
@Stone(path: 'i18n')
class Translation with _$TranslationHelper { // Generated mixin class or you can extend it also
  static LocalizationsDelegate<Translation> delegate = _$TranslationDelegate(); // Generated delegate

  static Translation of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of(context, Translation);
  }
}
```

You can now start using your localization logic:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
	          children: [
	          Text(
				  /// Returns a string repesented with a key "hello_there" in the localization files.
			      Translation.of(context).helloThere,
	          ),
	          Text(
				  /// Resolves the string, associated with the given key. The result is same as above.
			      Translation.of(context).resolve(TranslationKeys.helloThere),
	          ),]
		   )
        ),
      ),
      localizationsDelegates: [
       /// Returns the generated delegate, which will setup the [Translation] instances.
        Translation.delegate,
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale(SupportedLocales.english),
      ],
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The generated code backing the above functionality looks something like this (changes according to translation input):
```dart
class _$TranslationDelegate extends LocalizationsDelegate<Translation> {

  @override
  bool isSupported(Locale locale) => ["en"].contains(locale.languageCode);

  @override
  bool shouldReload(LocalizationsDelegate<Translation> old) => false;

  @override
  Future<Translation> load(Locale locale) async {
    var translations = Translation();
    await translations.load(locale);
    return translations;
  }
}

class TranslationKeys {
  static final String helloThere = "hello_there";

  static final String seeYouSoon = "see_you_soon";
}

abstract class _$TranslationHelper {
  Map<String, String> _translations;
  Map<String, dynamic> _resolutions;

  Future<void> load(Locale locale) async {
    var jsonStr =
        await rootBundle.loadString("i18n/${locale.languageCode}.json");
    Map<String, dynamic> jsonMap = json.decode(jsonStr);
    _translations = jsonMap
        .map<String, String>((key, value) => MapEntry(key, value as String));
    _resolutions = <String, dynamic>{
	    'hello_there': _translate(_translate(TranslationKeys.helloThere)),
	    'see_you_soon': _translate(_translate(TranslationKeys.seeYouSoon )),
	};
  }

  String _translate(String key) => _translations[key];
  dynamic resolve(String key) => _resolutions[key];

  String get helloThere => this.resolve(TranslationKeys.helloThere);
  String get seeYouSoon => this.resolve(TranslationKeys.seeYouSoon);
}
```

## Interceptors

In most cases we will end up with some kind of parametrization in some of our resouces, like displaying currencies, amount, etc... This is where interceptors can help us.

We can define our interceptor logic in `@Stone` annotated classes using `@Intercept` annotations. The annotation has two variants `@Intecept.simple()`, which describes interceptor logic for all resources, and `@Intercept.withFilter(filter)`, which provides custom logic for resources matching the provided filter pattern.

The below example shows our previous `Translations` class with interceptors.

```dart
@Stone(path: 'i18n')
class Translation with _$TranslationHelper { // Generated mixin class or you can extend it also
  static LocalizationsDelegate<Translation> delegate = _$TranslationDelegate(); // Generated delegate

  static Translation of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of(context, Translation);
  }

  @Intercept.withFilter(filter: r'%(?:(\d+)\$)?([\+\-\#0 ]*)(\d+|\*)?(?:\.(\d+|\*))?([a-z%])')
  String paramIntercept(String translation, var args) => sprintf(translation, args);


  @Intercept.simple()
  String simpleIntercept(String translation) => ">>> $translation";
}
```

The current generator logic doesn't support interceptor cascades, so only one interceptor will be applied to one tranlsation key. The logic always picks up the first matching interceptor for a key. If there's no matching interceptor it falls back to the original getter logic (simply returns what's defined in the JSON).

So, in the above example, if we have a key, which has atleast one matching translation for the provided filter, then the `paramIntercept` interceptor will be used, otherwise the `simpleIntercept` which is applied to all (remaining) keys.

The interceptor function must return `String` and also has to declare a `String` parameter as it's first parameter. After the first parameter you can declare other parameters if you like, but keep in mind, that all accessors generated for the matching keys will have the same parameters as the tailing ones following the first string input.

The interceptors in the examples will produce accessor entries in the resolution map like below:

```dart
'hello_there': simpleIntercept(_translate(TranslationKeys.helloThere))
```
and
```dart
 'hello_label': (dynamic args) =>
	 paramIntercept(_translate(TranslationKeys.helloLabel), args),
```

If we swap the two interceptors then the `simpleIntercept` method will be applied to all keys, because it matches any. And the filtering one will be applied to the remaining ones (which is an empty set of keys).
