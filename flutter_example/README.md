# flutter_example

A simple example for **Rosetta** just to demonstrate the usage to get localization for your Flutter app.

To launch the generator and get the missing parts of Translation class, execute the following command:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

## Web and Desktop support
With the introduction of Flutter 2.0 it is now possible to create web and desktop applications with Flutter, and this is no different when you're using `Rosetta`.

### Web
Please make sure you meet the following requirements:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web#requirements

Once you've made sure you meet the requirements, you can check what browsers you have available by running the following command and observing the output:
```
flutter devices
```
Afterwards, you can use the following command to serve your app on `localhost`:

```
flutter run -d <browser>
```
where `<browser>` is a browser previously listed by ```flutter devices``` that you want to use (e.g. `chrome` / `edge` / etc) .


And the following command to build your app as a web app:
```
flutter build web
```

### Desktop
Please make sure you meet the following requirements:
https://flutter.dev/desktop#requirements

Once you've made sure you meet the requirements, you can use the following command to enable desktop support for a platform for your app:
```
flutter config --enable-<platform>-desktop
```
where `<platform>` is one of the following: `windows` / `macos` / `linux`
(e.g. `flutter config --enable-macos-desktop`)

To ensure that desktop _is_ enabled, list the devices available by running
```
flutter devices
```
 You should see Windows, macOS, or Linux, depending on which platforms youâ€™ve enabled.

After you've successfully enabled desktop support for one (or more) of the aforementioned platforms, you can run the following command to launch your application:
 ```
flutter run -d <platform>
```
where `<platform>` is one of the following: `windows` / `macos` / `linux`
(e.g. ```flutter run -d windows```)

To generate a release build, run the following command:
```
flutter build <platform>
```
where `<platform>` is your platform of choice, e.g. `flutter build macos`.
